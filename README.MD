# Getting started

This project uses: [H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) 

## To execute

You need first to execute a REST service in [REST](https://github.com/HJELuis/rest-service)

Then you can access to `localhost:8080/h2-console` to manipulate the database content

## Before execution

You've already created a database with name `modulo 65` and tables `info_usuario`, `usuario`, `telefono`

You can add the data of your preference following the structure in the next examples

After the previous steps then you can execute this app and see the results on `localhost:8181`
